TicTacToe - Main Entry Point

This file acts as the central bootstrapper for the TicTacToe game,
instantiating the game logic (Board), the computer player AI (AI), and the GUI described in gui.py.

- All user interaction is handled by the GameGUI class.
- The Board class encapsulates all game state, rule enforcement, and victory/draw checking.
- The AI class can be configured to different difficulty levels, as selected by the user in the GUI.

The entire game should always be run and tested from this main.py file.
